# Modern-frontend-development-workflow
This is a modern frontend development workflow that includes a set of tools and dependencies to help developers write and compile modern JavaScript code using ES6 and ES7 syntax down to ES5, which is supported by all modern browsers.
The workflow includes the following packages:

@babel/core: Core Babel compiler for converting modern JavaScript code to ES5.
@babel/polyfill: Provides polyfills for new JavaScript features not supported by older browsers.
@babel/preset-env: A preset for Babel that automatically determines which plugins to use based on the user's browser support requirements.
@babel/preset-stage-0: A preset for Babel that enables the use of experimental features that are not yet standardized by the ECMAScript specification.
babel-loader: A Webpack loader that allows Babel to be used with Webpack to compile JavaScript code.
css-loader: A Webpack loader that interprets @import and url() statements in CSS files.
html-webpack-plugin: A Webpack plugin that generates an HTML file that includes all necessary bundles and scripts.
style-loader: A Webpack loader that adds CSS to the DOM using a style tag.
The workflow includes three scripts:

test: A placeholder script that can be used for running tests.
build: A script that uses Webpack to compile the code and generate a dist directory containing all necessary files.
start: A script that starts a development server using Webpack, allowing developers to test their changes in real-time.
This workflow provides developers with a solid foundation for building modern, scalable, and performant web applications using the latest JavaScript features, while ensuring compatibility with older browsers.
